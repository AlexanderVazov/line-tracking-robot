# ESP32-CAM Line-Following Robot
## Work Principle
The robot works by using a live camera feed, looking ahead of the robot, which looks for a black line on the ground in order to follow it. The camera captures images of the "track" and adjusts the input for both of the 2 DC motors (1 per wheel) accordingly so the robot doesn't swerve too far off the track/line.

## System Architecture

1. **Camera Input**: ESP32-CAM captures low-resolution images of the track.
2. **Image Processing**: The captured frame is processed to detect the position of the black line relative to the robot.
3. **Decision Making**: The robot calculates steering corrections based on line position.
4. **Motor Control**: PWM signals are sent to the L298N motor driver to adjust left and right motor speeds.
5. **Continuous Loop**: The robot continuously captures frames, processes them, and adjusts movement in real time.
